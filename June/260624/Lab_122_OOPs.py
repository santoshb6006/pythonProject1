#OOPs Concept
# Earlier we had PPL programming language
# where we can create only the functions

# what is an object -> Object is a real world entity which has some state(Attribute) like, name,id,Gender, Bllod Group, address etc
# and behaviour (walk, talk write, cook etc,.) These are the attribute and behaviour of a student
# PPl doesn't take of an attribute and behavior
# We need a programming lang. where we can store the real value
# Real world is nothing but class and objects in the programming
#OOPs is a programming paradigm that uses "Objects" to design applications and computer prgms.
#Attribute-> Data Variables, Properties.
# Behaviour-> Methods, functions

# Class-> it's a template of  blueprint where we'll write and object
